# Security Policy

FluentAAS is committed to providing a safe and reliable open-source library.  
We take security issues seriously and appreciate responsible disclosure.

---

## Supported Versions

Until the official **v1.0** release — which will include all current AAS Submodels compliant with the **AAS Standard 3.1.0** — **only the most recent FluentAAS version receives security updates**.

Older minor versions are not maintained.

| Version | Support Status                                      |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Latest  | ✔️ Fully supported (security & bug fixes)           |
| Older   | ❌ Not supported (please upgrade to the latest)     |

### Important Notes

- Pre-1.0 versions are considered **preview/early-stage** releases.  
- Only the **newest published version** will receive patches or fixes.  
- Once **v1.0** is released, we will introduce a stable Long-Term Support (LTS) policy with clearer guarantees.

To ensure you receive fixes and improvements, always use the latest version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

Please open a new issue in the github project.

Include:

- A clear description of the vulnerability  
- Steps to reproduce  
- A minimal code example if possible  
- Potential impact  
- Any suggested remediation ideas (optional)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgement within 72 hours**  
- **Initial assessment within 7 days**  
- If confirmed, we will work with you to:
  - Understand the issue  
  - Determine severity  
  - Develop and test a fix  
  - Coordinate a responsible disclosure timeline  

### Responsible Disclosure

Please **do not** open a public GitHub Issue for security vulnerabilities.  
We ask for private reporting to allow safe investigation and patching.

Once resolved, we may publish:

- A GitHub Security Advisory

- A note in the changelog  

Credit for discovery will be given if desired.
